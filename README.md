## **Introduction**
The social media friend recommendation system aims to enhance user experience and engagement on social media platforms by suggesting connections that align with users' interests and preferences. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze user data, extract relevant features, and calculate user similarities to generate personalized friend recommendations.

## **Features**
- Extraction of user features, including interests, demographics, location, and mutual friends.
- Calculation of user similarities based on cosine similarity or other suitable similarity measures.
- Personalized friend recommendations based on user similarities and preferences.
- Integration of social graph and user connections for improved recommendations.
- Evaluation metrics to measure the performance and effectiveness of the recommendation system.
- Example code and data to get started quickly.
